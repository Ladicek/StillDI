# StillDI

This is a proof of concept implementation of a translation layer between proposed Build Compatible Extensions and existing Portable Extensions.
It includes:

- `api`, the proposed Build Compatible Extensions API
- `impl`, the implementation based on Portable Extensions (with 2 tiny and isolated implementation-specific pieces, currently implemented for Weld)
- `test`, a playground based on JUnit Jupiter and Weld
